addToPostgres.py
This file adds eod stock price data to our postgres database

The database configuration is pulled from config.py and the
stock tickers are pulled from the desired text file

TODO: We should make this work asynchronously.
Right now, the program downloads all data and stores it in memory
in rowsList. It would make more sense to be downloading the data and
simultaneously adding it to the database.
This would drastically reduce our space complexity.
