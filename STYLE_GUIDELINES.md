# Style Guidelines 

> The Hedgehogs style guidelines in terms of code style are flexible

Hedgehogs requires that code follow these stipulations:
* Comment functions with [docstrings](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-docstrings)
* Use inline comments for any non-trivial code
* Avoid long lines greater than 72 characters
* Split a function into separate functions if too many lines of code are used
* Keep code to one statement per line and explicit
* Always surround these binary operators with a single space on either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.), comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <>, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not), Booleans (and, or, not)
